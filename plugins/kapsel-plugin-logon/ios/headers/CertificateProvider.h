/**
 Protocol defining an abstraction for certificate provisioning. The SDK ships with a couple of implementations, such as <code>AfariaCertificateProvider</code>,
 <code>FederationProvider</code> but application developers are free to create their own. Read on to understand the contracts.
 <p>
 There are multiple possible flows through which certificate provisioning is possible. This is the reason why all the methods of this protocol are optional.
 </p>
 <p>
 The asynchronous flow can be started using the <code>initialize:withCompletion:</code> method which will return the certificate via the completion block.
 </p>
 <p>
 Implementations which can provide a certificate without initialization may also implement the <code>getStoredCertificate:error:</code> method. Additionally,
 if the implementation allows for it, the <code>deleteStoredCertificateWithError:</code> method can be implemented to remove the stored certificate.
 </p>
 <p>
 Certain implementations might combine the two possible flows. This means that if a certificate is provisioned using the <code>initialize:withCompletion:</code>
 then later on this certificate can be retrieved using <code>getStoredCertificate:error:</code> as well. This is handy in situations when the asynchronous flow
 is used to display some kind of UI to ask input from the user after which the certificate can be acquired. Later on, the synchronous flow can be used to return
 the acquired certificate.
 </p>
 <p>
 The semantics of the option dictionary of <code>initialize:withCompletion:</code> as well as the semantics of the parameter dictionary that can be accessed via
 <code>getParameters</code> and <code>setParameters:failedWithError:</code> are implementation-dependent. Read the documentation of the implementation class to
 understand how and what they are used for. Being optional, an implementation might not even require options and parameters to function.
 </p>
 <p>
 By convention, all certificate provider implementations should support the default <code>init</code> method as there are components in the SDK which instantiate
 providers dynamically via introspection.
 </p>
 <p>
 The <code>getProviderID:</code> method is required if one wants to use certificate providers together with the Kapsel SDK.
 </p>
